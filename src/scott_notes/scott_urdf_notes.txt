URDF generator can only create single-branch-trees
To ensure high-fidelity IRDF assembly when combining limb urdfs to torso:
	-> user fake limbs when generating torso urdf (with "base" starting at one of the limbs, then "grow" the tree through toso to other limb)
	-> user fake torso when generating limb urdfs
This fakery is needed so that the joints connecting the limbs to the torso are the same for each urdf generated (makes it easier to combine serperate urdfs with xacro)
When making the limb urdf, use the fake torso as the "base"
